## Example
Applying various attacks to the Late Fusion model along Route 01 in Town05 Short.

## Installation

1. Install CARLA 0.9.11. Follow the instructions provided [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.11/start_quickstart/#carla-installation).
2. Clone this repo
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://gitlab.developers.cam.ac.uk/cst/prorok-lab/resilient-fusion-nav.git>
    ```
    
3. Setup a virtual environment with `Python 3.7` using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
4. Install Carlaviz at `resilient-fusion-nav/backend`. This is an OPTIONAL step as the tool is not essential for the working of the toolkit. Carlaviz is a third-party tool that allows you to visualise the expected and actual trajectories of the ego vehicle. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/mjxu96/carlaviz/blob/master/docs/build.md). Note: Between step 1.1 and 1.2, you also need to execute `git fetch --all --tags`.


## Usage
To start the toolkit, you need 4 different terminal windows to execute the following steps:

1. Start CARLA simulator.
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/carla/simulator
    ./CarlaUE4.sh
    ```
    
2. (Optional) Start Carlaviz backend.
    
    ```bash
    cd resilient-fusion-nav/backend/carlaviz
    ./backend/bin/backend
    ```
    
3. (Optional) Start Carlaviz frontend.
    
    ```bash
    cd resilient-fusion-nav/backend/carlaviz/frontend
    yarn start
    ```
    
4. Start toolkit
    
    In the `resilient-fusion-nav` folder, edit the `run_toolkit_home.sh` file and update the following variables:
    
    - CARLA_ROOT: path to your CARLA simulator installation
    - RESULTS_BASEPATH: to define the location where the metrics values would be stored
    - USE_CARLAVIZ: Set to True if you have install Carlaviz and wish to use it. Default=False
    
    NOTE: The toolkit uses CARLA (and leaderboard) at the backend. The issue with this though is that with the version 0.9.11 used here, to change the settings regarding the model and route information, you would need to manually restart the toolkit every time. 
    

## Work in progress    
- [ ]  Adversarial attacks on point cloud â€” currently all attacks are performed on the pseudo-image
- [ ]  CW attack on images does not work properly
- [ ]  Test with CARLA >0.9.11 to see if it resolves the issue of having to restart the toolkit with each test
- [ ]  Refactor and document code
- [ ]  Create a json file to define attacks at various points of the route
